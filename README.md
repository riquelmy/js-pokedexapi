# Pokedex 
**Pokedex** was an amazing and fun project I did for **DIO (Digital Innovation One)**'s Full Stack Bootcamp, in which I integrated a fully
responsive webpage to an API REST (in this case, <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">Pokedex API</a>).

## Overview

The purpose of this project/challenge was to put into practice all the skills I learned so far. I was challenged to build a fully responsive 
webpage (to exercise techniques such as mobile-first) and, simultaneously, integrate an API to the page I just created.

**Technologies/Tools used in it**: Git, Github, Node.js, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Vscode, <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">Pokedex API</a>
